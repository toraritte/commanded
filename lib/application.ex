    (1) Removing `EventStore.child_spec/0` breaks the external adapters
        `commanded/commanded-eventstore-adapter` and
        `commanded/commanded-extreme-adapter`,
        and the internal `InMemory` in partial.

        => Make them more OTP compliant as well.

    (2) The `InMemory` adapter is updated, but it is not started with
        the application anymore.

        => `InMemory` should be an external application so that
           it could be required only for testing.
